          BodyFit classes are
          <strong>
            1 hour, group workouts, lead by highly qualified instructors.
          </strong>
          The workouts are technically simple, but physically demanding. You
          will sweat, laugh, make friends, and be a little sore the next day.
          These workouts are a lot of fun and will get you amazing results.

          <strong>Is it good to go to gym everyday?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A weekly day of rest is often advised when structuring a workout
          program, but sometimes you may feel the desire to work out every day.
          <br />
          <br />
          As long as you’re not pushing yourself too hard or getting obsessive
          about it, working out every day is fine.
          <br />
          <br />
          Make sure it’s something you enjoy without being too strict with
          yourself, especially during times of illness or injury.
          <br />
          <br />
          Look at your motivation behind wanting to work out every day. If you
          find that taking off 1 day causes you to get off track and makes it
          harder to conjure up the motivation to return, then do a lighter or
          shorter version of your workout on what would be arest day.
          <br />
          <br />A common rule of thumb is to do 30 minutes of moderate physical
          activity each day, totaling a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate
          exercise each week. Or you can shoot for a minimum of 75 minutes of
          intense exercise each week.

          <strong>Reduce Your Health Risk</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Heart disease and stroke are two leading causes of death in the United
          States. Getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate physical
          activity can put you at a lower risk for these diseases. You can
          reduce your risk even further with more physical activity. Regular
          physical activity can also lower your blood pressure and improve your
          cholesterol levels.
