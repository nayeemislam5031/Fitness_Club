            Independent Days â€“ Members have unlimited access to the gym during
            opening hours for independent work. Most members choose to use these
            sessions to accelerate their cardio conditioning. Your trainer can
            prescribe an individualized program and training staff are always
            on-site to answer questions or provide guidance.
